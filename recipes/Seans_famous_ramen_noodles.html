    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This one is also pretty simple. You can tell I was once a ordinary college student. Take your ramen level to the next level with this simple recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ramen noodle of your choice</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Your choice of protein</li>
            <li>Your choice of greens</li>
            <li>Frozen fish balls</li>
            <li>Kimchi</li>
            <li>Splenda</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil recommmended amount of water in a pot</li>
            <li>Either steam frozen fishballs over the top of the water, or add fishballs directly into the boiling water</li>
            <li>After the fishballs are done cooking, add the noodles into the boiling water</li>
            <li>Along with the noodles, crack an egg and add it into the boiling water. Reduce heat to medium to avoid egg fluffing from the rapid boil</li>
            <li>After noodles and egg are done cooking, take pan off heat and add in green leafy vegetables</li>
            <li>Add in a sprinkle of pepper, cinnamon, and one pack of Splenda or brown sugar. I use splenda myself to add a little bit of sweetness to the broth</li>
            <li>Enjoy Sean's Famous Ramen Noodles</li>
        </ol>
